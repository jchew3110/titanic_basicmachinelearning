# titanic
Predict survival on the Titanic using scikit-learn Python library

## overview
The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

## Variable Notes
### pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
* 1st = Upper
* 2nd = Middle
* 3rd = Lower

### age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

### sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
* Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
* Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

### parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
* Parent = mother, father
* Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
* Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

## Setup
